    Triggers evaluation before the first training batch, so that you can benchmark all metrics before any finetuning

    It should be noted that although on_train_begin() exists, there is a bunch of stuff that comes after it. Hence,
    we use on_step_begin(), which is called after the dataloader's first batch is consumed but right before the model is
    referenced for the first time in the training loop.

    FIXME: This does still run 1 full gradient descent pass first... In CLM, it shows that half a million tokens (512 examples of 1024 tokens)
           are processed BEFORE entering the eval loop for the first time.

    In the Trainer training loop, the following order of calls happens.

    In the within-epoch loop:
        - on_step_end(): sets control.should_training_stop if global_step >= max_steps.
        - break if control.should_training_stop  (the loop will also exit naturally at the end of the epoch)

        - _load_best_model(): throws out the current weights and replaces them by the weights of the best checkpoint on disk
        - on_train_end()
