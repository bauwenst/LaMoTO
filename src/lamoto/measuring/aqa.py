"""
Back in university, I wrote a paper about why HuggingFace's SQuAD v2 metric is broken, and added my own metrics instead.
Here's what I wrote:

    HuggingFaceâ€™s evaluate module offers a SQuAD v1
    metric which, for a given set of predicted answer
    strings and reference answer strings, computes the
    unigram (i.e. word-by-word) exact match (EM) and
    F1 percentages.

    The same module also offers a SQuAD v2 metric
    which additionally measures an F1 score for the answerability
    classification task, judged based on the
    probability of a question being unanswerable and a
    threshold above which the question is classified as
    such. It purports to return the SQuAD v1 metrics
    as a subset of its output, but this is incorrect: span
    predictions are entirely ignored by this metric when
    the question is classified as unanswerable, even if
    it is answerable and the span is correct. This is
    unfair: good QA heads will receive a bad score
    due to a bad UA head. Hence, I re-implement the
    SQuAD v2 metric by keeping a clean separation
    between the two tasks.

I also documented the following quirks for the HuggingFace SQuAD v2 metric:
    - It assumes that there is a difference between the question being unanswerable and the actual answer being "".
      If you mess up this convention, the metric doesn't report its "NoAns" fields.

    - This gets even weirder: because HF forces you to give a prediction string (unlike the answer string), you would
      think that the only correct answer for an unanswerable question is "". Yet:
        - If your confidence is high, you can give it any non-empty string and it is accepted:
            - "aa" 0.9: good prediction
            - "" 0.9: good
            - "" 0.1: good
            - "aa" 0.1: bad prediction
        - If your confidence is low, an empty string is still accepted, and also, strings with stopwords count as empty strings:
            - "" 0.1: good prediction
            - "a" 0.1: good prediction
            - "the" 0.1: good prediction
            - "the a" 0.1: good prediction

    - If the actual answer is "" (so an answerable question with a zero-width answer), the confidence also affects everything.

-----

In total, I compute 18 metrics:
    - 14 for unanswerability, which is a binary task:
        - TP, TN, FP, FN
        - Accuracy
        - Re+, Pr+, F1+ and Re-, Pr-, F1-, where especially Re- and F1- are informative since SQuADv2 has a 67% class skew towards positives.
        - Class-macro Re, Pr, F1. Note that class-macro Re is also called "balanced accuracy", i.e. the mean accuracy
          across the sets of only positives and only negatives. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#balanced-accuracy-score
    - 2 for answerable examples:
        - Exact span match (EM): among the answerable questions, of those that you decide to predict a span for, how often is the full span correct?
                                 That is, EM == P(correct span | answerable AND predict answerable).
                                 This is a measure of how well your QA heads actually function. It does not take into
                                 account cases where you let the QA heads predict something despite knowing they will be
                                 wrong 100% guaranteed, nor where you refuse the QA heads to show what they can do despite
                                 knowing there is an answer 100% guaranteed.
        - Example-macro unigram F1
    - 2 for the combined task:
        - A correctness metric:
              P(correct) = P(correct, answerable) + P(correct, unanswerable)
                         = P(correct | answerable)P(answerable) + P(correct | unanswerable)P(unanswerable)
                         = P(correct span, predict ans | answerable)P(answerable) + P(predict unans | unanswerable)P(unanswerable)
                         = P(correct span | ans, predict ans)*P(predict ans | ans)*P(ans) + P(predict unans | unans)P(unans)
                         = EM_tp*recall_ans*skew + recall_unans*(1-skew)
        - Span EM adjusted for correct prediction of answerability:
              P(correct | ans) = P(correct span, predict ans | ans)
                               = P(correct span | ans, predict ans)*P(predict ans | ans)
                               = EM_tp*recall_ans
          This is equivalent to EM for a system which defaults to always predicting a wrong span when the
          answerability classifier wrongfully assumes there is no answer, which is never the case in SQuAD v1 and hence
          P(correct | ans) == EM == EM_tp in SQuAD v1.
