    HuggingFace datasets has a two-tiered back-off system and neither of them works to protect against hub outages
    parce que les incompétents ont fait du caca. https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/6843
        - huggingface_hub.utils provides the low-level http_backoff function which is used for all HTTP requests.
          It retries first with 1 second delay, then 2, then 4, then 8, then 8, and then it crashes.
        - datasets.utils.file_utils provides a function _add_retries_to_file_obj_read_method that monkey-patches the
          read method of an HfFileSystemFile to have constant-time backoff on certain exceptions. The amount of retries
          and constant delay are both customisable, EXCEPT IT DOESN'T CATCH THE RELEVANT EXCEPTION so NOTHING IS RETRIED.

    When HuggingFace goes down, a chain of three exceptions is raised:
        - TimeoutError in the ssl package
        - => ReadTimeoutError in the urllib3 package
        - => ReadTimeout in the requests package, which is not caught by the retry mechanism.

    Because `datasets` is heavy on passing around functions (in fact, they use monkey patching to even just add the
    retry mechanism, see datasets.utils.file_utils._add_retries_to_file_obj_read_method) and because the IterableDataset
    gets its data many __iter__ calls deep, you can't losslessly add backoff. The only way to do this would be to add it
    UNDERNEATH the deepest call to next(), because when next() is called and it fails, you can't retry it. The iterator
    has advanced. Best you can do is forget about that example and hope the next one doesn't fail.

           you entirely dependent on HuggingFace.
           Best you can do to salvage this class (but not for usage in LaMoTO) is to turn it into a None smoother, rather
           than an exception smoother, because exception can't be smoothed over externally while Nones can.

    Wraps a given iterable, and when the next() raises an exception during iteration, a back-off is applied rather than
    raising the exception immediately.

    Results that should have been generated by the failed next() calls are lost.

    The schedule should provide a good trade-off between the following two considerations:
        - Time between tries: shorter means less computing time is lost, but has a higher chance of encountering the same
                              outage and hence losing more data.
        - Time to end: longer means more likelihood of overcoming the outage, but if a crash is held out for too long,
