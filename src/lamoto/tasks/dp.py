        Here's the reasoning behind this method.

        The issue to solve is that when you are evaluating in the HuggingFace trainer, all predictions and labels are
        concatenated into one big tensor. The problem for DP arc predictions is that the amount of possible labels
        CHANGES every batch, because the labels are positions inside the given sentence. Hence, you can't concatenate the
        predictions for several batches because they don't have same amount of prediction classes.
        You don't see this problem in training nor the first evaluation batch, because there is no batch interaction (yet) there.

        As an example of the error you get:
           RuntimeError: The expanded size of the tensor (60) must match the existing size (58) at non-singleton dimension 2.
           Target sizes: [32, 58, 60].  Tensor sizes: [32, 58, 58]
        The first batch had 60 positions, the second batch had 58.

        Any solution for this has to basically force the Trainer to not accumulate logits, and instead commit them to the
        evaluation metric immediately (which is how supar does it). Here's how you could do that:
            1. Write a custom Trainer that has an evaluation_loop that just doesn't accumulate.
               The problem with this approach is that Trainer actually has a bunch of useful acceleration code.
            2. Use the existing Trainer but with empty validation dataset and use some kind of callback to evaluate the model inside
               the callback instead of in Trainer's evaluation loop.
            3. Trainer has an argument preprocess_logits_for_metrics that is called like
                    logits = preprocess_logits_for_metrics(logits,labels)
               before saving the logits. Here's how you could use that:
                    - Instantiate the UAS/LAS metric
                    - Capture it inside the preprocess_logits_for_metrics function and compute it immediately
                    - Let preprocess_logits_for_metrics return empty tensors as logits and labels
                    - Let computeMetrics return that metric's value.
               Another approach:
                    - Let preprocess_logits_for_metrics flatten the B x L x L logits into a B x LÂ² tensor.
                    - When the time comes to computeMetrics, have some way to identify the different lengths L and turn
                      them back into squares inside a Metric.compute.
               Yet another approach:
                    - Compress the B x L x L logits into B x L x 1 class argmaxes, rather than letting the metric do this.
                    - Let computeMetrics finish the process with UAS/LAS.

        This sneakyLogitTransform() method is used to perform the third approach, except more elegantly, we capture `self`
        (the only time Python allows currying is in expressions `self.method`) and then we access the metric instance
        that is already present in `self` anyway.

        The first two approaches have their place too, namely when you want metrics that aren't logit-based, like strided
        PPL in causal LM. That's not the case for DP though.
