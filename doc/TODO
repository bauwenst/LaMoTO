TODO: Implement QA. I wonder if you need a logit transform for this too. The Trainer tutorial
       for QA sidesteps this question: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/question_answering#evaluate

TODO: I'm not happy with how metrics are set up. It really makes zero sense to embed constructor arguments inside
      the task config to then parse them implicitly (if you didn't forget them) or error (because you did forget them).

FIXME:
  - It seems to me that the EvaluateBeforeTrainingCallback actually evaluates after one iteration.
    The only hypothesis I have is that the gradients are computed first, THEN you evaluate, and THEN you apply the gradients.
        - If this turns out to be an actual issue, I think you can just call trainer.evaluate() before the .train() call
          and indeed the FijectCallback will still add the result to its graph as per usual.
